# Disk Space Manager

Disk Space Manager is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that helps users efficiently manage their disk space. It offers a set of tools and visualizations to analyze disk usage, find duplicate files, delete unnecessary files, and compress large files to save storage space. This project aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly solution to manage and optimize disk space utilization.

## Key Features

- Visualize file system trees to understand directory structures.
- Find and remove duplicate files to reclaim storage space.
- Display disk space utilization through interactive pie charts or realistic SSD format.
- Identify and delete large files to free up storage.
- Compress files into ZIP archives for efficient storage.
- Clear temporary files to reclaim temporary storage space.
- Delete selected files to free up disk space.
